//Example
// 1 WBTC = 100,000,000 (8 decimals)
// 1 WETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (18 decimals)

//When both are priced at $50,000 USDC (50,000,000,000 units with 6 decimals):

// WBTC:
uint256 wbtcPerUnit = 50,000,000,000 / 100,000,000 = 500
//1 WBTC = 500 USDC per unit
//WETH:
uint256 wethPerUnit = 50,000,000,000 / 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 0
//1 WETH = 0 USDC per unit (rounds down!)

//This creates broken pricing where WETH appears free per unit while WBTC has a meaningful price.
